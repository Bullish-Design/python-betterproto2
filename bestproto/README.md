# BestProtoPy
An attempt at wrapping the general process of protobuf client/server/model generation. 

The end result of a CLI call should be a complete collection of nicely typed PydanticV2 models, a FastAPI client and server skeleton, and potentially some documentation scaffolds.

For now, just provides some helper commands for the python-betterproto2 library (that this library is a fork of)
